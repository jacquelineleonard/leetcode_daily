# A defanged IP address is a modified version of an IP address where the original dots (\(..\)) 
# are replaced with \(`[.]`\) to prevent it from being recognized as a clickable link or a functional address.
# This cybersecurity technique is used to safely share IP addresses in text form, such as in emails or online forums,
# so they don't trigger an automatic link and lead to accidental activation or malicious action.Â
